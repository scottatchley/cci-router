# Sample ccir_config
# Follows the CCI config file syntax with the following additions:
#
# as = <NUM>      where NUM is the Autonomous System ID.
#
#                 This value is unique per organization, requires that all
#                 internal subnets be routable to each other, and routes to
#                 other AS are via the WAN.
#
#                 Each CCI device must have one and only one AS ID. Each
#                 device's AS ID must be the same.
#
#                 If expecting to route to other AS, obtain an unique AS ID
#                 from ORNL.
#
#                 The value must fit in a uint32_t.
#
# subnet = <NUM>  where NUM is the subnet number for a specific, non-routed
#                 fabric and a specific CCI transport.
#
#                 By non-routed, each CCI endpoint within this subnet can
#                 communicate with every other CCI endpoint. The underlying
#                 network may be routed such as an IP network when using the
#                 sock transport.
#
#                 When a single fabric supports multiple CCI transports, each
#                 device description requires a unique subnet ID.  For example,
#                 if there is an InfiniBand fabric and the hosts have both the
#                 verbs and sock transports and the sock transport sees the
#                 IPoIB device, then the verbs device and sock device would
#                 need distinct subnet IDs.
#
#                 Within an AS, each subnet ID must be unique. Subnet IDs do
#                 not need to be unique across AS.
#
#                 Each CCI device must have one and only one subnet ID.
#
#                 The value must fit in a uint32_t.
#
# router = <URI>  where URI is the CCI URI of the router with which we wish to
#                 communicate.
#
#                 The router key/value pair is optional. If we are a router and
#                 if we are connected to every subnet, then we do not forward
#                 to any other routers. In this case, then we only need the
#                 devices with the AS IDs and subnet IDs.
#
#                 If the number of subnets in the AS is greater than the number
#                 of devices in this file, then we must forward via a router.
#                 In this case, there must be at least one router key/value
#                 pair in at least one device.
#
#                 A device may have multiple router key/value pairs per device
#                 if multiple routers are present on the subnet.

# In the below example, this router connects to three subnets.
#

#transport = gni
#interface = ipogif0
#port = 5555
